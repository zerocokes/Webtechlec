            <h1> INTERNET </h1>
<p> - A global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users
worldwide. </br>
- It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope,
that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. </p> 

 <h1> VINTON CERF </h1>
 <p> -Father of the internet </p>
 
 <h1> World Wide Web (WWW) </h1>
 
<p> - A global information medium which users can read and write via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a
synonym for the Internet itself, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, as e-mail does. </br> 

- In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support
from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA) and the European Commission. It comprised various companies that were
willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. </p>

<p>- Father of the web</p> 

<h1> HTTP (hypermedia) </h1>br>
<p> - Application layer used primarily to retrieve hypertext (on hypermedia) documents and resources on the World Wide Web </br>
- Jointly developed by the W3C and the IETF </p>

<p> Fundamentals
- HTTP typically runs on top of TCP/IP, using TCP port 80 by default (TCP port 443 for HTTPS). ; </br>
- HTTP resources are identified using URIs (specifically, HTTP URLs) </br>
o Scheme (http: or https:) </br>
o (optional) authentication information </br>
o Host and (optional) port number </br>
o Path (resolved to the document root on the server) to the resource </br>
o (optional) scheme-specific parameters </br>
o (optional) URL-encoded query </br>
o (optional) bookmark (or fragment identifier) </p>

 HTTP is based on client-server architecture
 Clients, aka user agents (UA):
o Web browsers, web crawlers, email clients, other end user tools and applications
 Servers:
o Origin servers, proxy servers, gateways, tunnels
 HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
o The client sends an HTTP request message to the server
o The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message
 HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
o Servers do not keep information about clients in between requests
o Web applications effect session tracking using mechanism such as cookies on URL-encoded session information to keep track of
related client requests
 HTTP provides support for other functionalities such as cache control, content media type (MIME) specification, language and character set
specification, content/transfer coding, client-server protocol negotiations, persistent connections, request pipelining, etc.
Cookie
 A very small text file
Cache
 Local storage/copy of resource that is fetched from a server
HTTP Response Message
 Status line
o HTTP protocol version
o Status code
o Reason phrase
 Response headers
 Empty line
 Message body
HTTP Request Methods
 GET
o Most commonly used HTTP method
o Used to request from the server the retrieval of the source identified by the request URI; the retrieved resource is returned in the
message body as an entity.
o Can be combined with conditional and/or range request headers to effect conditional and/or partial resource retrieval
o Must be supported by all general-purpose servers.
 HEAD
o Identical to GET, except the message body is not included in the response
 POST
o Request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the
Request-URI in the Request-Line.
 OPTIONS
o Request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI.
This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a
server, without implying a resource action or initiating resource retrieval.
 TRACE
o Request the server to “echo” back to the client the received request
o Typically used for testing/diagnostics of the request chain
 PUT
o Request the server to store the enclosed entity in the message under the specified request URI
 DELETE
o Request the server to delete the resource identified by the request URI
 CONNECT
o Reserved for use of tunneling proxy servers

Idempotent Methods
 The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property.
